# KCO

## Description
Schedule optimizer for the Kimberly-Clark production line

## CSI Hackathon Fall 2024
[Kimberly-Clark Production Schedule Optimization Hackathon](https://uwm.edu/csi/hackathon/)\
Hosted by the Connected Systems Institute, UW-Milwaukee

### The Challenge

Develop an algorithm that optimizes the production schedule for tissue machines and converting lines at a Kimberly-Clark facility, ensuring that customer demand is met while minimizing downtime and penalties for rule violations.

#### The Manufacturing Process

**Tissue Machines:** Two machines produce large rolls of tissue in six different grades.\
**Converting Lines:** Twelve converting lines transform these rolls into consumer-ready products. Each line has specific capabilities and constraints.\
**Inventory Management:** Manage roll storage to avoid running out of stock or holding excessive inventory.\
**Production Constraints:** Minimize machine downtime, avoid overlapping tasks, and reduce the frequency of costly grade changes.

#### The Data Sets
Teams will receive three distinct data sets:

**Data Set 1:** Real historical Kimberly-Clark production data.\
**Data Sets 2 & 3:** Increasingly complex scenarios designed to test the robustness of the teamâ€™s solution.

#### Important Dates and Deliverables

**October 14:** Information Sessions at 1:00 or 2:30 (at CSI)\
**October 21:** Hackathon Launch Sessions at 11:00 or 2:00 (at CSI)\
**November 3:** Submissions Due in Canvas\
**November 8:** Final Presentations at CSI\
**November 24:** Report Submissions Due (for top 3 teams only)\
**December 8:** Winners Announced
